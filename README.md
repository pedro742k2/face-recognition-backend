## ü§ñ What is the Face Detection App meaning?

Face Detection App is meant to detect and quantify the number of people's faces in a photo.
Although it's still in development, the Face Detection App is here to show off my skills with API data manipulation and React.js, JS and CSS skills by outlining the image detected faces inside boxes.

The Face Detection App also has a login/register system with profile credits, which are incremented in every successful API call.

## How to visit the project

### üåé Face Recognition API is available online as a demo

- üì° Live web app: https://pedro742k2.github.io/face-recognition-frontend
- üì° Live API server: https://face-recognition-server-pedro.herokuapp.com/api

### üè† But if you want to test it locally and make changes to the code (with **Docker**)

- Clone this repository to the desired directory
- Inside the project root directory:
  - Create an *environment variables* file called `.env` and, inside of it, add `CLARIFAI_API_KEY` with your Clarifai API key, `JWT_SECRET` with something random that comes to your mind and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with the PostgreSQL database password that you desire. In the end, it should look like this:
  - Folder and `.env` file structure:

    ![file  env](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54741310/160290637-e06fa828-4716-4e51-b2b8-9104472ff5d9.png)
    
  - On the `routes.js` file (located at: `src/routes.js`) comment the ssl object as indicated (line `36`) to run the local psql database successfully.

  - After setting up the environment, just run `docker-compose up --build` and the server + databases will be running automatically, with already two mock users created (`./database/mocks/seed.sql`).
